 # Odessey Restaurant

## About the Project
Welcome to the digital home of Nairobi's finest dining experience, where culinary passion meets the freshest local ingredients. This project is a responsive, multi-page website designed to capture the unique ambiance and exquisite flavors of our restaurant. Our goal is to provide an online presence that is as welcoming and memorable as a visit to our establishment.

The project consists of four main sections:

Home Page: A visually stunning introduction with a hero image, our unique value proposition, and a clear call-to-action to explore the menu or make a reservation.

About Page: The story behind our restaurant. Learn about our head chef, our farm-to-table philosophy, and our commitment to the Thika community.

Menu Page: A beautifully organized display of our culinary offerings, complete with enticing descriptions and pricing for starters, main courses, desserts, and beverages.

Contact Page: An easy-to-use form for reservations, our physical address with an embedded map, phone number, and opening hours.

The website is styled entirely with a custom CSS stylesheet, making use of advanced selectors, the box model, flexbox for layout, background images, custom fonts, and media queries to ensure a polished and fully responsive experience on all devices.
